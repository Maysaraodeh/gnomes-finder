Brastlewark is an almost exclusively gnomish city in eastern Cheliax, AXA heroes just arrived at Brastlewark and they want to trade with its population. but, the Gnomes at Brastlewark are very busy doing their daily work, moreover, they are not very social, so, we came up with Gnome Finder which is an application that facilitates trading between AXA heroes and the local population of Brastlewark, so the heroes can browse the population and trade with them easily.
